## Description

This is a simple web application to keep track of tasks. It is primarily an exercise in Document Object Model manipulation using vanilla Javascript.

Users are able to add new tasks, specify different task priority levels, complete tasks, and delete tasks as well. This application is completely browser-based, and does not use a database. Therefore, a page refresh will delete all input data and return to default values.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

This is a web-based application hosted on Github pages. Check out the To-Do List [here!](https://chriskorsak.github.io/to-do-list/)
